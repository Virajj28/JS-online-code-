# Operations

# ---Division remainder---
You can also use the remainder operator % which returns the division remainder. Here's an example:

8 % 2; // Division remainder is 0
7 % 2; // Division remainder is 1 

8 / 2 = 4
4 / 2 = 2
=> division remainder is 0 because 8 = 4 * 2 + 0

Where as for 7 % 2:

7 / 2 = 3 (rounded)
=> division remainder is 1 because 7 = 3 * 2 + 1

# Number methods
While there are some other methods you could call on numbers, they are not very commonly used. What is commonly used, however, is the Math object which contains methods such as min(), max(), round(), etc.
