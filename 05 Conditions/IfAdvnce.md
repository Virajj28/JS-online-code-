# Advanced If

You can drop else sometimes

# Legacy note
A quick legacy note. If you encounter == (double equal) in JavaScript, aim to replace it with === triple equal.
The double equal operator performs some conversions that you wouldn't expect. Always stick with triple equal instead.

# Always use triple equal === when comparing 2 values in JavaScript
