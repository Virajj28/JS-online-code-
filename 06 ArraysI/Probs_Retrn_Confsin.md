# Sum grades
Complete the function sumGrades such that it returns the sum of all the grades it receives as a parameter. We haven't seen reduce yet, so try to solve it using what you have learned so far

# logic same but implementation left behind.

<!-- function sumGrades(grades) {
  return grades.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
} -->

function sumGrades(grades) {
# let sum = 0;    
# grades.forEach(function(grade) {
# sum += grade;
});
# return sum;
}
