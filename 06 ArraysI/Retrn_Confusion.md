# Naming Variables 

Naming variables with a clear name makes it much easier for you and others to understand the code. This is especially true with iteration.

Thus, it's always a good idea to use the plural for the array and singular for the item of the array.
Here are some examples:

grades => item is grade
people => item is person

# Returning from a loop

Always it takes for plural
