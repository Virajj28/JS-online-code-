# Variables

# let
The first time you define a variable, you have to prefix it with let = . Let's take an example:

let name = "Sam";
console.log(name);
This defines a variable called name with a value of "Sam".

# Define a variable 
called count with an original value of 0 and then increment it (add 1 to it) on the following line.

-------Program code---------
Gr8 success!

//define a variable "count" with value 0
let count = 0;

//then increment it
count = count + 1;

console.log('count');
