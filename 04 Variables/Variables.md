# Variables

# let
The first time you define a variable, you have to prefix it with let = . Let's take an example:

let name = "Sam";
console.log(name);
This defines a variable called name with a value of "Sam".

# Define a variable 
called count with an original value of 0 and then increment it (add 1 to it) on the following line.
